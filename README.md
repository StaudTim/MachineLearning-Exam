# Machine learning - Exam

This project was an exam for the module "machine learning" as part of my studies in artificial intelligence. We had to analyse a data set and apply different learning methods to it. I took a data set from "www.kaggle.com" on which you can predict the house prices in California. The data set is called "California Housing Prices".

## Task
Run an analysis of the data set using R. This also includes:

- A descriptive analysis (using statistical indicators and graphs)
- The processing of a supervised learning problem with three alternative learning methods

Make sure that you carry out the analysis according to all the rules of technology. These include in particular:

- A descriptive analysis that focuses on the supervised learning problem (this includes in particular evaluations with regard to the later target variable)
- The appropriate selection of performance measures
- An appropriate split into training and test data
- An adjustment of tuning parameters with suitable methods



## Result

The three alternative learning methods that have been implemented are:

- Neural network
- Linear regression
- L2 boosting

Of the three, the neural network has the best house price predictions. It is also the method that takes the longest to train.
Second is L2 boosting, which doesn't take quite as long as the neural network to train. We get the worst prediction from linear regression.
